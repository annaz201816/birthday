            <h1>How You Walk with Me</h1>
            <p id="paragraph">
                I know this may seem weird but even from our first date I felt so much peace just by walking with you. It is such a simple thing but no one had ever made sure I walked on the farther side of the sidewalk. It was the first thing I noticed when we walked. I couldn't wrap my head around how something so simple could make me feel safe with someone. Then you became accustomed to me unlike anyone else had been willing to. I know this might sound like a selfish thing to do- to talk about how you made me feel, but it was truly unlike anything I had received from anyone in my whole life.
