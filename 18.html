            <h1>Your Presence</h1>
            <p id="paragraph">
                This is the last reason of this list but I could go on for hours about why I love you. I remember a couple of weeks ago we were not in the best place and you asked me to tell you why I love you. And I hesitated and I know you thought I can't even think of a reason, but the truth is I could. I don't know why I become the person I am during difficult times. But that's not the point right now. I made this list to show you how I can explain every part of you that I love in detail. And this brings me to the last thing- your presence. I think everything I said before this can be combined into this reason. But you are the only person on the planet whose presence I need and seek for every day. I think I took it for granted when I had it before all this distance between us. But the only time I feel pure joy and true happiness is when I know you're near me. The only thing I can even compare that feeling to is the peace I had when I was a little girl. I didn't think I could ever feel that way again but you are a walking radiation of love and comfort for me. You are my lover, my best friend, and my baby. Remember, even when we're 80 and 82 years old, you will always be my baby. I love you Davo.
