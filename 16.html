            <h1>You're My Favorite Nameless Feeling</h1>
            <p id="paragraph">
                Last year when I wrote you that letter for your birthday I felt so proud of myself to finally be able to describe something. That's kind of stupid because I don't even give it a name. Of course it's love but it's much more than that. I love a lot of things and people in my life but you're different. I hardly try hard with people to make sure we don't lose connection or our relationship. I have never seen myself be so stubborn about a person. I can't give a name to what I feel towards you. It is a combination of a lot of good and warm feelings. But even when I feel anger or frustration with you my body doesn't let me feel that for too long. And I'm not one to not hate or not be negative, I think we both know that. But something about how I feel about you stops me from being anything but caring towards you.
