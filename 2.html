            <h1>Your Eyes</h1>
            <p id="paragraph">
                Your eyes are the most honest eyes I have ever seen in my life, I don't know if it's because I see purity whenever I look into them, but there is no other pair of eyes that I look into in the entire world and feel the same comfort I do with yours. You always compliment my eyes and never want to take my compliments about yours, but I really want you to believe me when I tell you I could quite literally stare into them for eternity and never get tired. It feels like they were designed exactly for me. I think they're a part of the reason I'm starting to believe in fate because I know I have seen the eyes I am meant to look into until the day I die.
