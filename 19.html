                Hey Davo, it is currently 12:13 AM, August 16, 2023. I hope whenever it is that you are reading this, you’re doing well. Initially, the idea with this website was to add a page with your every birthday, adding another reason as to why I love you. Now that we are not together anymore, I think there are more complicated feelings we have for each other that might not be love (or at least I do). I promised you a year ago that I would try my hardest to forgive you for what you did and to move on from it all because I knew I had too much love for you to just simply let go of you. And I did try, you like to think I didn’t but I did. You were not with me every night staying up until 3 am crying myself to sleep replaying all the texts and pictures that I saw on your phone. And yet I had to wake up every morning forcing myself to try to act normal again. You changed everything about me as a person. I cannot count the amount of sleepless nights I spent questioning our relationship, if you ever even loved me, why you loved me, why you did those things to me, if I was ever enough for you to begin with, and so many more stupid, stupid questions. I spent a whole year crying every single night as I lost a piece of my heart slowly. And I know I wasn’t particularly nice to you during this time. It hurt me a lot what I was doing to you as well. You liked to point out everything I was doing wrong which I admit were very hurtful towards you. You never listened to me when I told you I was trying. And sometime around January or March I felt the energy coming from you change as well. I realized with the way I was acting, you had started the process of unloving me. You had told me before that once you stop caring there is no turning back. Now I could feel it slowly happening. This is why I tried to break up with you a million times during that time. I couldn’t stand the fact that I was the one who was initially giving you a second chance, and now I felt like you were just tolerating me being there. You ruined me Davo, and I mean it quite literally. You have the ability to stop caring for someone and move on with your life, but I don’t. You know how hard I can love and I used so much love on you that I was completely in denial that you could deny all that love one day. You taught me how to love someone, now you’re teaching me how to unlove someone. You taught me how to care about someone so so sooo deeply, and now you’re teaching me how to stop caring for that same person. Talking to you recently made me realize I had a false idea of your love. It was never eternal and it was never going to last. You emotionally drained me of my love, but kept your best for your next person. You used me as your experiment to become a good partner for your next girlfriend. I just finished reading all the 18 reasons before this and I am in complete awe. I don’t know how we went from that to this. My biggest fear was you talking to me without caring about me, like a complete stranger. And it came true. Now I have started the process of unloving you which should be easy because I don’t think I’m capable of it anymore. This was quite long and I doubt you even check this website anymore. I hope your life is good and you found happiness. Happy birthday Davo.
