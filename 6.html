                I feel like it's one of the most common things a girl likes about a boy. But I never really realized how much love I can feel from a body part. It is one of the most amazing forms of you demonstrating your love every time you hold my hand, you hug me, you hold my face, or when you run your fingers through my hair. I think it's honestly such a beautiful human thing that we can show so much love and affection just by touch. It never really occurred to me how much safety I can feel from something so simple and so pure like the touch of my favorite human being on this planet - you.
