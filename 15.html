            <h1>Your Devotion to the People You Love</h1>
            <p id="paragraph">
                You became a different person once you fell in love with me and felt comfortable with me. I think this is pretty common but I've never seen someone completely change with me when they took me as an important part of their life. I finally saw how loving and devoted you were to your favorite people. I was just glad I was a part of it. I think you have a special way of caring for people when you perceive them differently. You do have a habit of not caring about a lot of things but that completely changes once you're with someone you love. Till this day I can feel you try your hardest with me to make sure I'm happy. I think dew people would be willing to use the majority of their energy on making sure someone else is doing good, and somehow I've found one of the few.
