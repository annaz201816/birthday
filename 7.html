            <h1>Your Patience</h1>
            <p id="paragraph">
                I am not exaggerating when I tell you you are the most patient person I have ever met in my life. It is honestly one of the things I have tried to imitate and incorporate in my life. I know myself well enough to know that if I met myself I could not be patient with such an unpredictable person. I know I can be difficult to deal with, trust me. I have a very specific personality that even I can't deal with sometimes. And the fact that you are willing to work with me and understand me and even help me is one of the best ways you love me. I know I don't say this enough but I appreciate your efforts so much even if I don't show it every day.
