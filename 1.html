            <p id="paragraph">
                You have the most sincere and the most beautiful smile I have ever seen in my life. I can never forget the first time I saw you smile. Of course the sun shining on you helped a little, but that's besides the point. My heart fills with pure joy after seeing you smile even just for a second. It is like medicine to me when nothing else can heal me. I think that's the first trait I would like to see in our kids one day. I have never seen anything more perfect on a person, so why wouldn't I want to double it or triple it (duh). I know somestimes I cause the exact opposite of a smile on you, for which I actually do feel sorry for (I really do, I'm not lying), but I never feel happier than the times I make you smile. It is the world's greatest gift to know I inflicted the simplest and the purest form of joy on your face - your smile.
