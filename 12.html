            <h1>Your Willingness to Change</h1>
            <p id="paragraph">
                It is a difficult thing to accept one's flaws and actively choose to do something about them. I have met countless people who decide they're perfect the way they are and don't put in effort to become better. It's a clich√©, I know. And I also know you think that I think you haven't changed since I met you. But I do. I want you to know that I see your progress, and I see you have chosen to change. I think relationships are funny. They are so hard to work at but such a reward in the end. And you can think of a lot of things in life like that. But love is different. I told you this before but you feel like a vacation from work. I feel at ease when I'm with you. And you can't have that unless you work for it. I really need you to understand that I appreciate your work, and I am willing to work until the last second I breathe to make sure this is the best goddamn job I've ever done.
