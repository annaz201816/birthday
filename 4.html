            <h1>Your Voice</h1>
            <p id="paragraph">
                I have told you this a million times and I will never stop saying it. Your voice was one of the first things I noticed about you. Honestly at first I thought it was way too mature for your age, but it felt weirdly nice. I loved talking to you even though the majority of it was me rambling and talking about the dumbest things and complete nonsense. After you became a part of my life nothing made me happier than hearing you talk. We both know I can be annoyed by the smallest and the most pointless things (I know I have to work on it). But weirdly enough I met someone who could talk about the most stupid and senseless things and yet I enjoy it more and more every single day.
