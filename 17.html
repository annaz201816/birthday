                I hate that you think you're lazy. It was one of the first things you told me on our first date. I don't know who put that into your head. You work so hard and try so hard for something you're passionate about. You have been trying your whole life to be a good son. I know it's a hard thing because I've been doing the same with my parents. You tried with me. You try every day to make me happy. And I know that you're not in the happiest place of your life right now which makes me so sad. But the truth is you wake up every day and try to put a happy face on and work on yourself until you're able to feel happiness. You work hard on the things you care about, and I see it every day. I really do admire it even if I don't talk about it very often.
