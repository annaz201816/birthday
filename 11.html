            <h1>Your Selflessness</h1>
            <p id="paragraph">
                Ever since I've had you in my life. I've heard you tell me how you're a selfish person. I want you to understand that there is nothing selfish about you. It makes me sad that even your dad chose to say those things to you but the truth is you are the most selfless person I have in my life. You don't see it and sometimes you even refuse to admit it but you put others above you. I know my words can be hurtful especially during times when I'm mad. And I know some things have stuck with you or even validated your thoughts about yourself. But I want you to fully believe me when I tell you I know no one and have never had anyone that chose to hurt themselves just to see even a sparkle of joy in my eyes. We both made mistakes in our relationship and yet you still put my feelings first and prioritize my happiness.
