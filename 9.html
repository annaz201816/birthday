            <h1>Your Ability to Listen</h1>
            <p id="paragraph">
                This is something I really admire in people because I know I have to work on this myself. You made me fall in love with you with your ability to listen to people. You make people feel welcome to talk and you put in effort to understand someone and what they're trying to get across with their point. This isn't something a lot of people can do. It might seem like it but it's not. And I know you don't like bragging or thinking of yourself highly but if you took a step out of your consciousness for a second and looked at yourself from my point of view, you would realize how admirable your ability to listen and understand is.
