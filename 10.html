            <h1>The Way you Perceive Life</h1>
            <p id="paragraph">
                We both know we have different outlooks on life, and I think in the last two months it has become very apparent. And I know it has been hard for both of us, especially considering what we've gone through. But even after everything you're willing to try. You're willing to give your all for a life you envision with me. I know you might think you're lazy or don't use all your potential fully, but the truth is after everything that happened, mentally you gave every last bit of energy you had to keep a positive look on life. Because you're not selfish. You know if you don't use all your energy to keep yourself alive people will suffer, I will suffer. Thank you for that.
